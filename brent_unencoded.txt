Glad to know boy's parents finally did somezing right. Zey left  farm, zough I still feel  boys father should have faced  
more extreme konsequence for raising  lying boy child. Oh vell. Ve vent off to barn vhere zis metal zing is 
supposed to be. Boy vasn’t lying about sick kow. I suggested ve kill zing and eat it, kan’t let meat go to vaste, 
but  others seemed repulsed. Veak and vasteful. I don’t understand  people here. Proper resource, zey just vaste. Up in  hayloft ve found  
metal zing.  metal zing says its name is zirrrty-tvo-squared. Sounds like math, not subject I kare for. You kan’t beat out  ansvers from  math 
problem. Anyvays, it said zat ve vere foolish for sending lying man child toby avay. Apparently, boy is kontaminated. I not sure why ve should 
help zis silly device zing when it broke its own zings law, but maybe ve should. He knows rough lokation of where boy and his family vent, and 
ve should make haste to save  child, again. I feel extra eyes on me, and I niet longer trust my journal entries vill remain secret, so I’ve 
written next part in kode. Hopefully zat vill keep prying eyes avay.
